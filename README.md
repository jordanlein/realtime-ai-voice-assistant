## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/jordanlein/realtime-ai-voice-assistant.git>
cd realtime-ai-voice-assistant
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

You'll need to configure your API keys in an environment file.

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Open the `.env` file and add your API keys and configuration values:

    ```env
    # Your OpenAI API Key
    VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

    # Your Google Cloud API Key for the Custom Search API
    VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIza..."

    # Your Google Custom Search Engine ID
    VITE_GOOGLE_CSE_ID="..."
    ```

*   `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
*   `VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `VITE_GOOGLE_CSE_ID`: To enable the web search feature, you need to set up a Google Custom Search Engine. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Google CSE Setup Guide](./GOOGLE_CSE_SETUP.md).

### 5. Run the Application

Once your environment variables are set, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).
